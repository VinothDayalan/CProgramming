# C Programming Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of C programming exercises and projects that I am practicing to enhance my skills while learning the C programming language. Each exercise or project is designed to cover different concepts and techniques, allowing me to gradually improve my understanding and proficiency in C.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/VinothDayalan/CProgramming.git
```

## Prerequisites

To compile and run the C programs in this repository, you will need to have a C compiler installed on your machine. The most common C compiler is GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), which is available for various operating systems. Make sure you have GCC installed by running the following command:

```
gcc --version
```

If GCC is not installed, please refer to the documentation for your specific operating system on how to install it.

## Usage

Each exercise or project in this repository is contained within its own directory and has its own set of instructions. To compile and run a specific program, navigate to its directory and use the following command:

```
gcc program_name.c
```

This command will compile the C source code and generate an executable file named `program_name`. To run the program, use the following command:

```
./a.out
```

## Project Structure

The structure of this repository is organized as follows:

```
.
├── exercise_name-1
│   ├── programname1.c
│   ├── programname2.c
│   └── ...
├── exercise_name-2
│   ├── programname1.c
│   ├── programname2.c
│   └── ...
├── project_name-1
│   ├── source.c
│   ├── header.h
│   ├── makefile
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

- Each exercise is contained within a separate directory, named `exercise_name-n`, where `n` represents the exercise number.
- Each project is contained within a separate directory, named `projectname-n`, where `n` represents the project number.
- Each program or source file is named according to its purpose or functionality within the exercise or project.
